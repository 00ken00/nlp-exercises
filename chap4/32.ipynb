    "â˜… Develop a simple extractive summarization tool, that prints the sentences of a document which contain the highest total word frequency. Use `FreqDist()` to count word frequencies, and use sum to sum the frequencies of the words in each sentence. Rank the sentences according to their score. Finally, print the n highest-scoring sentences in document order. Carefully review the design of your program, especially your approach to this double sorting. Make sure the program is written as clearly as possible.\n",
